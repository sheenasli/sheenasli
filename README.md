⚡ Fun fact: I've swam with Whale Sharks! <br><br>
💻 I'm a store manager/banker/teacher turned full-stack developer, embracing the exhilarating world of code. My life has been marked by ever-changing environments where stepping out of my comfort zone has become the norm. Growing up in a military family, teaching English in Korea, and banking at JP Morgan Chase, continual learning and change have always been a part of my life.

In my quest for personal growth and societal impact, I discovered software engineering. It provides a creative outlet where I can leverage the solution-oriented approach and client service mantras honed over years in various industries. Although new to the tech industry, I've been completely consumed by the potential that this skill set and field offer.

Long-term, my vision is not only to provide leading-edge, client-centric solutions but also to become an established member of the tech community, paving the way for other women. It's about breaking barriers, building bridges, and ensuring a more inclusive and impactful tech landscape. Let's code the future together!
